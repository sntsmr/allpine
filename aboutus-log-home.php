                        <blockquote>
                            <p align="justify">   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1940's, Allpine Lumber began as a small lumber mill, focused principally on producing rough-cut dimension lumber for the residents of a 
                                small part of southern Colorado. Today, Allpine Lumber is one of the principal suppliers of house logs and other planed materials for log homes, not only 
                                for Colorado, but also for most of the Midwest and other parts of the United States.</p>

                            <p> Our priority has always been, and will always be, quality and integrity both in our products and in our service.<br /> We keep up with the most modern 
                                equipment and technology in order to provide the best products. Customer satisfaction is important to us. If you are not completely satisfied with your 
                                purchase, let us know and we'll resolve it.</p>

                            <h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>
                            <p>&quot;I built log homes for many years in the Midwest, using different logs from different companies. I came to the conclusion that shrinkage and untrue logs were just part of the business-- not true. I moved to Colorado and began building with Allpine’s logs. I’ve built 4 homes since then and can’t believe how square they are. I’ve experienced virtually no shrinkage and can truly say these are some of the best logs I’ve ever used.&quot;</p>

                                "They (Allpine Lumber) have an intimate knowledge of the industry... from tree harvest, milling, drying, preparation and delivery. AND they had my coveted plus, <strong>experience in building log cabins</strong>. They were and are truly wonderful to work with…my wife and I just unwrapped a bunk of their logs tonight as we were building, and they just make you stop and look at them. You can’t help it, the logs are beautiful!"<br />
